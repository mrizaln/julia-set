Julia Set


I want to improve my [previous code](https://github.com/mrizaln/mandelbrot-set), but at the same time I want to challenge myself to code in C. So, here we are.


But then, I want to take this code further: render [Julia Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set) (the Mandelbrot Set is still rendered tho ヾ(＾-＾)ノ).
